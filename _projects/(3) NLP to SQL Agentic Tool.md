# NLP to SQL: An Agentic AI Tool

## Overview
Engineered a Streamlit web application that translates natural language queries into SQL, executes them on uploaded datasets, and generates relevant visualizations using the SmolAgents Framework powered by Google's Gemini.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language to SQL Translation**: Converts plain English questions into SQL queries
- **Query Execution**: Runs the generated SQL on uploaded datasets
- **Automated Visualization**: Creates appropriate charts and graphs based on query results
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses SmolAgents framework to coordinate specialized AI agents
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple Streamlit UI for easy interaction

## Technical Details
This project leverages several cutting-edge technologies:
- **Streamlit**: For the web application framework
- **SmolAgents**: A lightweight multi-agent orchestration framework
- **Gemini API**: Google's powerful language model for natural language understanding
- **SQL Parser/Executor**: For translating and running database queries
- **Data Visualization Libraries**: For creating meaningful visual representations of data

## Workflow
1. User uploads a dataset
2. User enters a question in natural language
3. The NL agent translates the question to SQL
4. The SQL executor runs the query against the dataset
5. The visualization agent determines and generates the most appropriate visualization
6. Results are displayed to the user in an intuitive format

## Project Timeline
March 2025 - Present

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more complex SQL queries
- Additional visualization options
- Query optimization suggestions
- Integration with database systems beyond uploaded files
