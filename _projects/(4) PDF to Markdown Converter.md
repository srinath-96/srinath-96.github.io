# PDF to Markdown Converter

## Overview
Developed an intelligent document conversion tool that leverages OCR technology and large language models to transform PDF documents into well-formatted Markdown while preserving the original document's structure, formatting, and styling elements. This solution addresses the common challenge of extracting and converting content from PDFs into editable, version-control friendly formats.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Text Extraction**: Uses advanced OCR techniques to precisely extract text from PDFs
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains document hierarchy (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- **Table Conversion**: Transforms complex tables into Markdown table format
- **Image Handling**: Extracts and properly references images from the source document
- **Smart Formatting**: Preserves text styling (bold, italic, underline)
- **Batch Processing**: Supports converting multiple documents with a single command

## Technical Details
- Implemented custom OCR preprocessing pipeline to improve text recognition accuracy
- Developed intelligent structure detection algorithms for identifying document elements
- Utilized large language models to enhance formatting decisions and error correction
- Created a modular architecture allowing for easy integration with document management systems

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OCR Libraries
- Large Language Models
- Document Processing Frameworks
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Timeline
May 2025 - Present

## Applications
