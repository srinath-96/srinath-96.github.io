# Rejection Email Deleter: Intelligent Email Management System

## Overview
Created an automated solution that leverages natural language processing to identify job application rejection emails, categorize them, and perform specified actions (such as moving to trash, archiving, or applying labels) based on user preferences. This tool helps job seekers maintain an organized inbox during the application process.

## Key Features
- **Smart Detection**: Uses NLP to identify rejection emails with high accuracy
- **Customizable Actions**: Configurable handling of detected emails (delete, archive, label)
- **Gmail Integration**: Seamless connection with Gmail accounts via the Gmail API
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large volumes of emails
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and configuration process
- **Privacy-Focused**: Processes emails locally without storing sensitive content

## Technical Implementation
- Implemented a rejection pattern recognition system using keyword analysis and context understanding
- Designed a secure OAuth2 authentication flow for Gmail API access
- Created efficient email processing pipelines for handling large inboxes
- Developed a configurable rule system for customized email handling
