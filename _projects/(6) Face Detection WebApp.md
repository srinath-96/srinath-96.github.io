# Face Detection WebApp

## Overview
Developed a web-based face detection application that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and analyze human faces in real-time video streams or uploaded images. The application provides detailed facial analysis including emotion detection, age estimation, and gender recognition.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Process webcam feeds for immediate face detection
- **Image Upload Analysis**: Analyze faces in uploaded photos
- **Multiple Face Processing**: Detect and analyze multiple faces simultaneously
- **Facial Feature Analysis**: Identify key facial landmarks and features
- **Emotion Detection**: Recognize emotional expressions in detected faces
- **Age and Gender Estimation**: Provide demographic insights about detected individuals
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface for easy interaction

## Technical Implementation
- Implemented face detection algorithms using OpenCV and deep learning models
- Developed a responsive Flask web application for the user interface
- Created efficient image processing pipelines for both static images and video streams
- Optimized the application for performance on standard hardware
- Ensured privacy by processing all data locally without external storage

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Docker (for deployment)
