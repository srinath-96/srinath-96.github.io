# Immutable Binary Tree using Functional Programming

## Overview
Implemented an immutable binary search tree using functional programming principles in Java. The implementation includes a hash chain construction and Merkle tree functionality to compute and return a Merkle root, demonstrating core concepts used in blockchain technology.

## Key Features
- **Immutable Data Structure**: Created a truly immutable binary search tree where operations produce new trees without modifying existing ones
- **Functional Programming Approach**: Used pure functions and avoided side effects
- **Hash Chain Implementation**: Integrated cryptographic hash functions to create verifiable chains of nodes
- **Merkle Root Generation**: Computed a single hash value representing the entire tree structure
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintained efficiency despite immutability constraints

## Technical Details
- **Tree Operations**: Implemented standard operations (insert, delete, search, traverse) maintaining immutability
- **Hash Function**: Utilized cryptographic hash functions for node identification
- **Merkle Tree Algorithm**: Built a complete implementation of Merkle tree generation
- **Verification Mechanism**: Created methods to verify data integrity using the Merkle root
