# Pac-Man Finite State Machine

## Overview
Developed a Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation to model and control the behavior of ghosts in a Pac-Man game. This project demonstrates the application of FSM concepts to game AI, creating more realistic and dynamic enemy behaviors.

## Key Features
- **State-based Ghost Behavior**: Implemented multiple states for ghost AI including chase, scatter, frightened, and idle
- **Transition Logic**: Created conditional transitions between states based on game events
- **Object-oriented Design**: Utilized inheritance and polymorphism for extensible ghost behavior
- **Visualization**: Included visualization of the state machine for debugging and demonstration
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Designed a system that responds to game events like power pellet consumption

## Technical Implementation
- Created a modular FSM framework that can be extended for other game characters
- Implemented state persistence and history tracking
- Developed a clean separation between state logic and rendering
- Integrated collision detection with state transitions
- Documented the architecture using UML diagrams

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-oriented Programming
- FSM Design Patterns
- Game Development Principles
